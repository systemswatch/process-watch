# PROCESS WATCH ACTIONS DIRECTORY

**Actions**

You can put your action shell scripts here for easier locating, however this is not mandatory, action shell scripts can be called from anywhere.

The shell script can be bash or language of your choosing as long as its executable and can be called by its path (ex. `/usr/local/process-watch/actions/action.sh`), also ensure the script has an interpreter defined (ex. `#!/bin/bash`). Example actions could be restarting the process, collecting troubleshooting info, notification or anything you need during when the threshold is met.
